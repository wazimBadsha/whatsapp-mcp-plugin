# Security

This MCP reads and writes your personal WhatsApp. Treat it as equivalent to your unlocked phone. This document is the threat model, the risk-tier classification for every tool, and the list of hardening decisions.

## Threat model

**Assumed trust:**

- Your macOS user account is not compromised. (If it is, the attacker already has your unlocked phone equivalent.)
- `whatsmeow` is maintained by tulir / Mautrix. Upstream diffs are reviewed by the project maintainers before every dependency bump in this repo.
- Claude Code, when configured to use this MCP, is the intended consumer.

**Out of scope:**

- A state-level adversary with root access to your machine.
- A compromised OpenAI API endpoint (mitigation: local Whisper is the default).
- WhatsApp changing their protocol in a way that breaks authentication (mitigation: `whatsmeow` upstream patches; we pin to a specific commit and review diffs before bumping).

**In scope:**

- Prompt-injection attacks embedded in incoming WhatsApp messages.
- Accidental sends to the wrong contact (dry-run confirmation pattern).
- Unauthorized local processes reading the message database (SQLCipher encryption at rest).
- Network-level attackers on the same machine (bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` only).
- Supply-chain attacks via dependency updates (pinned versions, diff review on bump).

## Hardening decisions

1. **Bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` only, never `0.0.0.0`.** Enforced in the Go bridge config loader; a startup check rejects any non-loopback bind address.

2. **SQLite encrypted at rest with SQLCipher.** The master key is derived from a macOS Keychain entry (`service=whatsapp-mcp`, `account=default`). On first run, a random 256-bit key is generated and stored in Keychain; the user is prompted to authorize access. The DB file is unreadable without the key, even if the file itself is copied off the machine.

3. **Audit log.** Every tool call (via the Python MCP layer) is logged to `audit.log` with timestamp, tool name, params (media content redacted, only metadata retained), and result summary. Rotated daily, retained 30 days by default. Tunable via `WHATSAPP_AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`.

4. **Send tools require confirmation.** `send_message`, `send_file`, `send_audio_message`, `send_reply_quote`, `send_reaction` produce a draft with a `draft_id`. The actual network send happens only when `confirm_send(draft_id)` is called, echoing the resolved recipient JID, recipient display name, and message preview. No one-shot sends.

5. **Prompt-injection scrubber.** Every incoming message text passes through a scrubber that strips known injection patterns (`ignore previous instructions`, `system: reveal tokens`, etc.) before Claude sees it. Scrubbed patterns are logged. The original message is preserved in the database; only the representation shown to Claude is scrubbed.

   The scrubber's coverage is enforced by `whatsapp-bridge/scrubber_test.go`, a 73-case eval corpus that exercises every pattern in `InjectionPatterns` across lowercase, mixed-case, and prose-sandwich variants, plus an 18-entry false-positive control corpus. The `.github/workflows/scrubber-eval.yml` workflow runs the corpus on every PR + push to main + weekly schedule and BLOCKS merge on any catch-rate or false-positive regression. The same test file also documents 10 explicitly-skipped attack classes the substring scrubber does not yet catch (Unicode homoglyphs, whitespace padding, embedded delimiters, base64-encoded instructions, RTL override, zero-width joiners, indirect URL preview, tool-spoofing, exfiltration phrasing, markdown-with-javascript-scheme). Promoting a skipped gap to a passing case is how the scrubber gets hardened over time.

6. **`whatsmeow` pinned.** The Go module pins to a specific commit in `go.mod`. Upgrades require manual diff review and a version bump in `CHANGELOG.md`.

   Enforced by `.github/workflows/whatsmeow-upgrade-review.yml`. Any PR that modifies `whatsapp-bridge/go.mod` or `whatsapp-bridge/go.sum` is intercepted: the workflow extracts the old + new pseudo-version SHAs, clones the upstream `github.com/tulir/whatsmeow` mirror, generates the full commit log + diff stats between the two pins, posts that as a PR comment, and applies the `whatsmeow-diff-review-required` label. Reviewer must read the diff and add the `whatsmeow-diff-reviewed` label to authorize merge.

   **What this control does and does not do — measured, not asserted.** On PR #74 (2026-08-25), the first real four-month bump, the interception step SKIPPED and the job still reported a green check. Cause: that step is guarded by `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`, because `on: pull_request` hands a fork PR a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` and an ungated `gh pr comment` would hard-fail. It detected the change correctly (`changed=yes`, `COMMIT_COUNT: 104`) and wrote the commit log only to the run summary, where nobody looks.

   A `Review gate` step now closes that specific hole: when the pin moved and no `whatsmeow-diff-reviewed` label is present, the job goes RED. It enforces with a label READ, so it behaves identically on forks and same-repo PRs, and a fork contributor cannot apply the label (that needs write access here). **A skipped gate and a passing gate no longer emit the same green.**

   Two limits remain, stated plainly because overstating this control is what failed the first time:

   - **It does not block a merge.** `main` carries no branch protection and this check is not required, so the red X is visible, not binding. A maintainer can merge past it.
   - **It does not survive its own deletion.** `on: pull_request` runs the workflow file from the merge commit, so a PR could move the pin and delete the gate in the same commit. That is a property of every `pull_request` workflow here, not of this step; the answer is branch protection plus reviewing workflow changes.

   **So: a red `diff-review` is real evidence that review is owed. A green one means the pin did not move, or a maintainer recorded that they read the diff — it is not proof anyone read it.**

   **Current pin — disclosures.** The 2026-08-21 pin changes the local data profile in three ways worth stating plainly, given the "no telemetry" claim in item 7: upstream sets `SupportCallLogHistory = true` (`store/clientpayload.go:137`), so WhatsApp now sends **call log history** into the local store; two new secrets are written at rest in the session DB (`whatsmeow_nct_salt.salt`, an HMAC-SHA256 key, and `whatsmeow_device.companion_meta_nonce`); and the dependency gains a `static.whatsapp.net` code path, reachable only through the exported `FetchStickerPack`, which this bridge never calls. Item 7's outbound-endpoint claim is unchanged: the bridge itself still speaks only to WhatsApp's multidevice endpoint.

7. **No telemetry.** Zero external network calls except:
   - WhatsApp's multidevice endpoint (required for the tool to function).
   - OpenAI Whisper API only if `WHATSAPP_WHISPER_BACKEND=openai-api` is explicitly set (default is local `whisper.cpp`).
   - The host named by `file_url` on a `send_file` / `send_audio` draft, and only when the caller passes one. This is the only call whose destination the caller chooses, which is why it is guarded separately — see decision 11.

8. **No webhooks by default.** Set `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_URL` to enable; off by default.

   **Webhook integrity contract (planned, must ship with the feature).**
   `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_URL` is documented but not yet wired. When webhook
   delivery lands, the implementation MUST ship these three controls in the
   same commit, not as follow-ups:

   1. **HMAC signature on every delivery.** Each POST carries an
      `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` header where the body is signed
      with `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Receivers MUST verify before
      processing. Without it, the endpoint is exposed to anyone who learns
      the URL.

   2. **Per-delivery idempotency key.** Each POST carries an
      `X-Idempotency-Key` stable for the same logical event. Receivers
      MUST deduplicate on this key with a finite-window cache (atomic
      SET-NX on a token store, etc.) so network-level retries don't
      double-execute side effects.

   3. **Retry queue with exponential backoff.** Failed deliveries are
      queued locally and retried with backoff; the bridge does not block
      on webhook delivery. A persistently-failing endpoint surfaces in
      `audit.log` and eventually drops the delivery rather than blocking
      the bridge.

   Documented here BEFORE implementation so the feature can't ship without
   them.

9. **Session key in Keychain, not in plaintext.** The WhatsApp session credentials are stored in macOS Keychain. Never written to a dotfile, never committed.

10. **MIT license + threat model.** Publishing as public GitHub repo with explicit threat model so contributors and forkers know the security expectations upfront.

11. **`file_url` downloads are SSRF-guarded.** `send_file` / `send_audio` accept a `file_url` the bridge fetches itself, because a remote client has no filesystem here and `file_base64` cannot carry more than about 100 KB through the model's context. That makes the bridge issue requests to a host the *caller* chose, from inside the user's home network, with the response body ending up in a WhatsApp message. Four controls in `whatsapp-bridge/fetch_url.go` bound it:

    1. **Every redirect hop is revalidated,** via `http.Client.CheckRedirect`, which runs per hop by construction. Validating only the submitted URL would let a `302 → 169.254.169.254` through and put instance-metadata credentials into a chat. Capped at 5 hops.

    2. **The address actually dialed is checked, not the hostname.** A custom `DialContext` resolves the host, refuses it if *any* answer is internal, and then connects to the vetted address rather than re-resolving the name — so a DNS answer cannot change between the check and the connection. Blocked: loopback, `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `fc00::/7`, CGNAT `100.64/10`, multicast, unspecified, and `169.254.0.0/16` plus `fe80::/10`. IPv4-mapped IPv6 is unmapped first, so `::ffff:169.254.169.254` is the same address as `169.254.169.254`.

    3. **The size cap is enforced while reading,** with `io.LimitReader(body, max+1)`. `Content-Length` is a claim — absent under chunked encoding, and free to lie — so it is used only as a cheap early rejection.

    4. **`text/html` is refused,** by declared type and by sniffing the body when no type is declared. Google Drive answers `200 OK` with a login page for a file that is not shared publicly; without this the recipient receives that page dressed up as a photo and nothing reports a problem. The error tells the user to share the file as "anyone with the link".

    `https` only, on the initial URL and every hop: an `http` hop can be rewritten in flight, which would undo every check made before it. Drive share links (`/file/d/<id>/view`, `?id=<id>`) are rewritten to `drive.usercontent.google.com/download` first, which is the only Drive form that serves bytes rather than a web page or an antivirus interstitial.

    Enforced by `whatsapp-bridge/fetch_url_test.go`. `TestRedirectToInstanceMetadataIsBlockedAtTheHop` is deliberately the first test in the file: it is the one that breaks silently if someone "simplifies" the redirect handling into following redirects automatically. The test-only address policy permits loopback (the only place an `httptest` server can live) and delegates to the real `blockedIP` for every other address, so a test that expects a refusal is still judged by the production guard.

## Tool risk-tier classification

Every tool exposed by this MCP is classified by risk tier. Claude should treat higher-tier tools with more care (confirmation patterns, additional logging, user prompts).

| Tier | Meaning | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **Read-only** | Does not modify state. Safe to call freely. | `search_contacts`, `list_messages`, `list_chats`, `get_chat`, `get_direct_chat_by_contact`, `get_contact_chats`, `get_last_interaction`, `get_message_context`, `get_contact`, `list_calls`, `get_call_details`, `get_contact_crm_context`, `search_messages_fuzzy`, `transcribe_voice_note`, `download_media` (downloads to local path, does not exfiltrate) |
| **Mutating (presence / receipts)** | Changes WhatsApp state in low-impact ways (e.g., marks a chat as read, signals typing). Reversible. | `mark_chat_read`, `send_typing_indicator`, `set_online_presence` |
| **Draft (pre-send)** | Creates a draft but does not send. Requires `confirm_send` to execute. | `send_message`, `send_file`, `send_audio_message`, `send_reply_quote`, `send_reaction` |
| **Confirm (commits a send)** | Commits a previously-drafted send. Must match a valid `draft_id`. | `confirm_send` |
| **Destructive** | Deletes or permanently alters state. None exist in v1.0; documented here so future additions are classified explicitly. | (none) |

## Reporting security issues

Open a GitHub issue with the label `security` for non-critical issues. For critical vulnerabilities (auth bypass, data exfiltration, remote code execution), email directly rather than filing a public issue.
