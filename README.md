<!-- mcp-name: io.github.adelaidasofia/whatsapp-mcp -->

A WhatsApp MCP server for Claude, built directly on [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow). Encrypted at rest, prompt-injection-scrubbed, draft-and-confirm on every send, full audit trail, daily CI security gates. Actively maintained.

## Why this one?

The most-starred WhatsApp MCP (`lharries/whatsapp-mcp`, 5.6K stars) is the architectural reference for this pattern, but has not shipped since July 2025 and leaves the [lethal-trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) problem entirely to the user. This implementation closes the gaps:

| | Canonical | This implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Last shipped | July 2025 | Active |
| DB encryption | Plain SQLite | SQLCipher with key in the platform secret store (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / libsecret) |
| Prompt-injection scrubber | None | Every inbound message |
| Send safety | Fires immediately | Mandatory `confirm_send` between draft and delivery |
| Audit log | None | Every tool call, 30-day retention |
| Voice notes | Not transcribed | `whisper.cpp` local, Spanish-tuned default |
| LID alias resolution | Open issue cluster upstream | Shipped, with backfill migration for legacy threads |
| CI security | None | `govulncheck` + `pip-audit` + Dependabot, daily |

Not a fork. The Go bridge is built directly against `whatsmeow`; the Python MCP layer and SQLite schema are original. Other implementations (`lharries`, `LukasHaas`, `verygoodplugins`) were read as reference only.

## What this gives you

Claude can:

- Read your WhatsApp chats, messages, and contacts
- Search messages with accent-insensitive, typo-tolerant matching
- Transcribe voice notes locally via `whisper.cpp` (Spanish-tuned by default)
- Resolve LID (Linked IDentifier) names instead of numeric placeholders
- Send text messages, reactions, and reply-quotes, with a mandatory `confirm_send` step between draft and delivery
- Pull matching CRM context from your Obsidian vault when reading a chat
- See only prompt-injection-scrubbed message text, never raw adversarial input

Everything runs locally on your machine. No cloud sync. No telemetry. Optional OpenAI Whisper backend is opt-in, off by default.

## Architecture

Two components, both local:

- **`whatsapp-bridge/`** (Go). Binds to 127.0.0.1 only. Wraps `whatsmeow` for the WhatsApp Web multidevice protocol. Owns SQLite persistence with SQLCipher encryption. Handles QR and pairing-code auth (live-refreshing terminal QR with Windows-safe rendering, plus a headless auth API — `GET /api/auth/qr`, `POST /api/auth/pair-phone`, `POST /api/auth/reconnect` — so a GUI or supervisor can drive pairing without a terminal), media up/download, session recovery from `StreamReplaced` conflicts, call history capture. Exposes a REST API the Python MCP layer consumes.
- **`whatsapp-mcp-server/`** (Python, FastMCP). Consumes the Go bridge REST API. Exposes 11 MCP tools to Claude: full read surface (chats, messages, contacts), accent-insensitive search, presence (typing, online, mark-read), and text-send + reactions + reply-quotes with mandatory `confirm_send`. Runs via `uv` and stdio transport.

## Install

Open Claude Code, paste:

    /plugin marketplace add adelaidasofia/whatsapp-mcp
    /plugin install whatsapp-mcp@whatsapp-mcp

This installs the Python MCP server side. The Go bridge still needs the one-time QR pairing flow with your phone — see the legacy install block below for those steps.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (full Go bridge + QR pairing)</summary>

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for step-by-step install per OS. In short:

1. Grab a prebuilt bridge binary from [Releases](../../releases/latest) (Windows/macOS/Linux — no compiler needed), or build from source (Go 1.26+ and a C toolchain)
2. Python 3.11+ and `uv` for the MCP server layer
3. Clone this repo; verify with `scripts/check_prerequisites.sh` (Windows: `scripts\check_prerequisites.ps1`)
4. Start the bridge: `./bin/whatsapp-bridge` (Windows: `.\bin\whatsapp-bridge.exe`)
5. Scan the QR (it refreshes in place — always scan the one on screen), or pair by typed code with `--pair-phone +15551234567`
6. Register the MCP in your Claude Code `.mcp.json`
7. Restart Claude Code

FFmpeg and whisper.cpp are only needed if you enable voice-note transcription (off by default).

## Configuration

All configurable via environment variables. See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list.

Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8080` | Go bridge REST API port |
| `WHATSAPP_DB_PATH` | `$HOME/.claude/whatsapp-mcp/store/messages.db` | Encrypted SQLite database |
| `WHATSAPP_MEDIA_PATH` | `$HOME/.claude/whatsapp-mcp/media/` | Media file storage |
| `WHATSAPP_VAULT_CRM_PATH` | empty | Absolute path to your vault CRM folder for auto-injection (e.g., Obsidian `👤 CRM/`). When unset, CRM injection is disabled. |
| `WHATSAPP_WHISPER_BACKEND` | `off` | `off` (zero-config boot), `local-cpp` (private, needs a whisper model), or `openai-api` (opt-in) |
| `WHATSAPP_WHISPER_API_KEY` | empty | Required only when backend is `openai-api` |
| `WHATSAPP_WHISPER_MODEL` | `large-v3` | whisper.cpp model name |
| `WHATSAPP_SCRUB_PROMPT_INJECTION` | `true` | Strip known prompt-injection patterns from incoming messages before Claude sees them |
| `WHATSAPP_AUDIT_LOG` | `true` | Log every tool call to `audit.log` |
| `WHATSAPP_ENCRYPT_DB` | `true` | Enable SQLCipher DB encryption; key in the platform secret store (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / libsecret) |
| `WHATSAPP_DB_KEY` | empty | Explicit 64-hex-char SQLCipher key override (skips the platform store). Escape hatch for headless/CI/custom secret managers, and the recovery path when the secret store cannot be read — see below |

### The DB key and `WHATSAPP_DB_KEY`

With `WHATSAPP_ENCRYPT_DB=true` (the default), the bridge encrypts the message
store with a 256-bit SQLCipher key kept in the platform secret store. The key
lifecycle is deliberately conservative, because a wrong key silently orphans
every stored message:

- A fresh key is minted **only** when the secret store definitively answers
  "no such item" (macOS `errSecItemNotFound`, Windows `ERROR_NOT_FOUND`,
  libsecret clean miss) **and** no non-empty store database exists yet.
- Any other failed read — locked keychain, no D-Bus session, revoked access —
  makes the bridge exit with an error instead of minting: the key may still
  exist, and overwriting it would make the encrypted store permanently
  undecryptable. The error names the fix (e.g. `security unlock-keychain`).
- If the secret store has no key but a populated store database exists, the
  bridge also refuses to mint and asks you to supply the original key.

`WHATSAPP_DB_KEY` (64 hex chars = 32 bytes, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) is
the escape hatch for all of these: when set, it is used directly and the
platform secret store is never touched. Use it for headless/CI machines,
custom secret managers, restoring a store on a new machine, or booting while
the platform store is unavailable.

## Security

This MCP is the highest-trust component in your Claude stack because every WhatsApp message you receive flows through it. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, tool risk-tier classification, and the full list of hardening decisions.

Short version:

- Bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` only, never `0.0.0.0`
- SQLite encrypted at rest with SQLCipher; key stored in the platform secret store (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / libsecret), with an explicit `WHATSAPP_DB_KEY` escape hatch
- Every tool call logged to `audit.log` with 30-day retention
- Send tools require an explicit `confirm_send` step between draft and delivery
- Incoming message text passes through a prompt-injection scrubber before Claude sees it
- `whatsmeow` pinned to a specific commit; upgrades require diff review
- No telemetry, no external API calls by default

## Status

## MCP Registry

Published on the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.adelaidasofia/whatsapp-mcp) under `io.github.adelaidasofia/whatsapp-mcp`. Two live channels:

- **`.mcpb` bundle** (canonical, recommended) — one-click install in Claude Desktop / Cursor / any [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb)-aware client. Published as a GitHub release artifact at [releases/latest/download/whatsapp-mcp.mcpb](../../releases/latest/download/whatsapp-mcp.mcpb). The release manifest carries the SHA256 for tamper detection.
- **PyPI package** (`adelaidasofia-whatsapp-mcp`) — historical; available via `uvx adelaidasofia-whatsapp-mcp` for stdio-installer flows. The unprefixed names (`whatsapp-mcp`, `whatsapp-mcp-server`) are taken by unrelated projects on PyPI, hence the username-prefixed namespace.

The verification marker `mcp-name: io.github.adelaidasofia/whatsapp-mcp` is embedded in this README (HTML comment near the top) so the registry can verify package-to-server ownership at publish time.

**Publishing pipeline:** built and shipped via the Mycelium MCP publishing pipeline (two-phase: `.mcpb` bundle build, then `gh release` + `mcp-publisher publish`). The same pipeline produced all 16 sibling MCPs in this family.

## Telemetry

This plugin sends a single anonymous install signal to `myceliumai.co` the first time it loads in a Claude Code session on a given machine.

**What is sent:**
- Plugin name (e.g. `slack-mcp`)
- Plugin version (e.g. `0.1.0`)

**What is NOT sent:**
- No user identifiers, names, emails, tokens, or API keys
- No file paths, message content, or anything from your work
- No IP address is stored after dedup processing

**Why:** Helps the maintainer know which plugins people actually install, so attention goes to the ones that get used.

**Opt out:** Set the environment variable `MYCELIUM_NO_PING=1` before launching Claude Code. The hook will skip the network call entirely. Already-pinged installs leave a sentinel at `~/.mycelium/onboarded-<plugin>` — delete it if you want to reset state.
