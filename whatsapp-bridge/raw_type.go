// raw_type.go — the decode outcome as an INDEXED value rather than a string
// parsed back out of user-facing content (MYC-3577).
//
// /healthcheck's decode counters used to be derived with
// `content_text LIKE '[unsupported: %'` over every `system` row. Correct, and
// unscalable: measured on the live store, five consecutive calls took 14.75s,
// 8.65s, 2.88s, 3.19s and 1.48s. That spread is the signature of a scan, not of
// a slow query. A cold monitoring poll always pays the top of the range, and
// the `system` population grows ~400/day.
//
// It was also the wrong coupling. An operator-facing metric should not depend
// on the exact bytes rendered into a member's chat file.
//
// messages.raw_type (migration 006) records the outcome once, at write time, in
// a column that can be indexed and grouped. Every writer derives it through the
// ONE function below, so the value that gets counted and the marker that gets
// displayed cannot drift apart. That is the same single-declaration discipline
// unsupportedPrefix / undecryptablePrefix already use.

// rawTypeUnknown is what an unparseable marker records. The pre-MYC-3577
// counters reported a malformed marker as "unknown" instead of dropping it, and
// that behavior is preserved deliberately: a row we cannot classify is still a
// row we failed to read, and silently excluding it from the total would be the
// same class of bug these counters exist to expose.
const rawTypeUnknown = "unknown"

// rawTypeEmptySystem marks the PRE-floor silent drops: a `system` row with no
// content at all, which is what MYC-3284's bug produced and what the backfill
// is driving to zero.
//
// They get a sentinel instead of being left NULL so that ALL THREE counters
// come from the ONE covering aggregate. The alternative was an index over
// (type, content_text), and measured on SQLite that is the only shape that
// covers an empty-content_text predicate: a PARTIAL index on exactly that
// predicate is simply never chosen by the planner. Indexing content_text would
// copy every message BODY into an index on a 75MB store, which is a real cost
// to pay for one counter.
//
// The colon is deliberate: proto field names are identifiers and can never
// contain one, so this can never collide with a real raw type recovered from a
// marker.

// rawTypeForStorage maps a row's stored (type, content_text) to the value
// messages.raw_type should hold, or "" for a row that decoded fine and belongs
// in no counter.
//
// It takes msgType as well as the text because "an empty `system` row" is a
// counted population and an empty row of any other type is not. Deriving that
// from content alone would either miss the legacy drops or sweep in ordinary
// empty captions.
//
// Resolution order matches the migration's backfill exactly, which is what
// makes the migrated numbers equal the pre-migration numbers:

//	empty `system` row               -> "empty:system"
//	anything else                    -> ""
