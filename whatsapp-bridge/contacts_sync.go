// contacts_sync.go — the user's own address book.
//
// The bridge knew every contact by the name that contact chose for themselves
// (push_name) and by nothing else. That is rarely the name the user thinks in:
// a partner saved as "Mi Amor" broadcasts "Dra Ivette De La Vega", a plumber
// saved as "Plomero Casa" broadcasts a company slogan. Asking the bridge for
// "Mi Amor" returned zero results, and the fallback — supply a phone number
// instead — asks the user to remember the one thing an address book exists so
// they never have to.
//
// The data was already on this machine the whole time. WhatsApp syncs the
// address book through app state and whatsmeow keeps it in its own
// ContactStore, where types.ContactInfo carries FullName and FirstName next to
// PushName. The bridge had zero references to Store.Contacts. This file is the
// missing read.
//
// Two entry points, one write path:
//
//   - SyncContactNames, once at startup, sweeps the whole store. This is what
//     retroactively names chats that have been anonymous for months.
//   - onContactUpdate, on events.Contact, keeps a rename made on the phone from
//     waiting for the next restart.
//
// The address book beats push_name for a second reason beyond being the name
// the user recognises: it does not need the other person to say anything. A
// chat where every message is outgoing — 0 incoming out of 40 is a real case on
// this account — can never learn a push_name, because push_name only arrives
// attached to an inbound message. The address book names it anyway.
