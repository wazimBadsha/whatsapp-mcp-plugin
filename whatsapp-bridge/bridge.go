//   - Group message. PushName is whichever participant happened to speak, never
//     the group subject.
//
// An empty push name also yields "", rather than falling back to the sender's
// JID user part the way sender_display does. For an @lid JID that part is an
// opaque LID number, and a chat labelled with one is worse than a chat with no
// label: NULL is a state every other writer knows how to fill, while a wrong
