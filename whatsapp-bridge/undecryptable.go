// undecryptable.go — persist a row for a message that never reached the decoder
// (MYC-3569).
//
// MYC-3284 fixed the case where a message is RECEIVED and DECODED into an empty
// row: it now keeps a loud "[unsupported: <rawType>]" marker. This file covers
// the strictly worse case one layer earlier.
//
// whatsmeow dispatches events.UndecryptableMessage and RETURNS when a message
// cannot be decrypted — no events.Message follows. Until now handleEvent had no
// case for it, so the bridge wrote nothing: no row, no marker, no counter. The
// message exists for the human in the WhatsApp client and does not exist for the
// brain in any form. MYC-3284's fail-loud guarantee cannot reach it, because
// extractContent is never called. There is not even an empty row to count, so
// export, /healthcheck and retrieval could not report the absence either.
//
// The fix mirrors MYC-3284's idiom deliberately: a row built from evt.Info alone
// (id, chat, sender, timestamp, is_from_me) carrying a distinct, queryable
// marker in content_text. Same reasoning as there for why the signal rides in
// content_text and not in a new `type` value: messages.type has a CHECK
// constraint (migrations/001) that SQLite cannot widen without a full table
// rebuild, which is a disproportionate risk to a live 113k-row store.
//
// The rows are RECOVERABLE, which is what makes the upgrade path load-bearing.
// whatsmeow asks the sender for a resend on our behalf (sendRetryReceipt /
// immediateRequestMessageFromPhone), so a share of these arrive later as a
// normal events.Message on the SAME message id. onMessage's upsert is what
// turns that arrival into an in-place upgrade rather than a no-op — see the
// ON CONFLICT clause in bridge.go, which is written against this file's marker.
